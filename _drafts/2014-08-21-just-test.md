In my post _Coding With Intent_ I introduced the _nQueens_ puzzle and performed some of the requisite groundwork to establish the domain of our problem. We know that given a number _n_ we need to return a number that represents the total valid solutions we can generate by placing _n_ queens on an _n_ x _n_ such that none of the queens is threatened by any other queen.

I identified step 2 as _Write tests that verify a solution_. This blog post with outline the the process of installing a testing suite as well as writing and executing tests.

We are going to focus on _unit_ testing which aims to validate the functionality of specific blocks of code. From [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Unit_testing):

>Unit testing is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs...Unit testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process.

_Unit_ testing is typically the first phase of an overall testing plan which may also include _integration_ testing. I won't cover integration testing here.
